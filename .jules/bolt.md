18:31-08/05/2026 : [Batch DOM Appends with DocumentFragment]
Learning: Appending DOM elements inside a loop causes multiple reflows, which is a common performance bottleneck in SPAs. Using a DocumentFragment allows batching these appends into a single 'live' DOM update.
Action: Always use DocumentFragment when generating table rows or lists dynamically from data arrays.

21:04-09/05/2026 : [DOM Query Optimization in State Loading]
Learning: [Using document.getElementById inside a loop can be a performance bottleneck, especially during initialization or state restoration where multiple inputs are updated. Caching elements by ID into a dictionary/map during script initialization avoids repeated DOM traversal.]
Action: [When iterating over a known set of elements (like inputs for state saving/loading), query the DOM once and map the elements by their IDs for fast O(1) lookups.]
