PeakLoad is a sleek powerlifting companion that helps you plan training sessions with confidence. Estimate your one-rep max using the Epley, Brzycki, or Lombardi formulas, then convert those numbers into ready-to-use percentage tables for programming.

## Features

- **Percentage Builder** - Generate working weights across any intensity range with configurable increments.
- **Warm-Up Planner** - Build ramp-up sets with configurable templates and plate jumps.
