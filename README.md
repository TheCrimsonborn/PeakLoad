# PeakLoad

PeakLoad is a sleek powerlifting companion that helps you plan training sessions with confidence. Estimate your one-rep max using the Epley, Brzycki, or Lombardi formulas, then convert those numbers into ready-to-use percentage tables for programming.

## Features

- **1RM Estimator** – Quickly approximate your max using the Epley, Brzycki, or Lombardi formulas.
- **Percentage Builder** – Generate working weights across any intensity range with configurable increments.
- **Warm-Up Planner** – Auto-build progressive warm-up sets from your top weight using preset templates.
- **Unit Toggle** – Flip seamlessly between kilograms and pounds; outputs update instantly.
- **Localized UI** – Switch between English, Türkçe, and Русский via the language dropdown.
- **Modern UI** – Responsive, polished interface tuned for desktops and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser—no build step required.
2. Enter a recent heavy set to estimate your 1RM, then build percentage tables or warm-up plans from that result.
3. Use the header controls to change units (kg/lb) or language (EN/TR/RU).

To customize styling, edit `styles.css`. To adjust formulas, warm-up templates, or copy, modify `script.js`.
